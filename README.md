# bootcamp_grads_track
Purpose: Use real data from Bootcamps in Utah (starting in Utah maybe more after) to track job offers, interviews, and other things like interview questions. All this to help motivate grads to keep going, feel connected to groups and get jobs. Also use a real world project to build skills in C# and other areas for recent grads or any devs looking to contribute.


### Tech Stack
- Backend: Asp.NET C# WebAPI 
- FrontEnd: TBD, possibly Angular or React
